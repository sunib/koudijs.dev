Presenting stuff is a fun activity, but preparing powerpoints isn't my favourite. You want something that looks nice and shiny but you don't want to spend to much time on it. At the same time I like text based file formats. So why not combine these?

That's what the makers of Marp did, they even created a smoothly working vs code plugin.

## Hints

* They have a very nice [vscode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode).
* This also works with front matter.
* Your full presentation is in one file. You can use the `---` signs to create a new page. 
* You can also use the `headingDivider: 1` in your frontmatter to indicate that you want to page break when you are using header 1.
