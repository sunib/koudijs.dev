What could we improve on the website itself

Choosing a good font, and fully desiging the html myself:
* https://www.11ty.dev/docs/ (replacement for hugo, looks a bit simpler)
* https://shivjm.blog/how-i-built-shivjm-name/
* https://www.sarasoueidan.com (she has a interesting book)

Examples:
* https://joshcrain.io/about/running/ (integration wit garmin watch ðŸ˜Š)
